Important regression tests for Crikey.
Should run every test with both -t and -x except as noted.
Add -s secs as needed to change focused window.
==========================================================

crikey "cat < /etc/lsb-release"
  Make sure the < comes out right.

crikey "echo foo > /dev/null"
  Make sure the > comes out right.

crikey "cat \(less\) /etc/lsb-release"
  Make sure the < comes out right.

crikey "echo foo \(greater\) /dev/null"
  Make sure the > comes out right.

crikey "wall\nHello, world\n^D"
  Should run wall without needing any extra input.

crikey -t "\A\t"
  Should change the active window (in most window managers).
  This needs XTest (-t) and doesn't work with XSendEvent.

crikey '~\Cz'
  Do this when sshed into another computer: should suspend the ssh.

crikey 'oHere is a line\e\e'
  Do this when in vim, not in insert mode. Should add a line,
  jump out of insert mode then beep if your machine supports that
  (for the second escape).
